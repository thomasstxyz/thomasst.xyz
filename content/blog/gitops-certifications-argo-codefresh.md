This week I enrolled in the free certification courses
[GitOps Fundamentals (2022)](https://learning.codefresh.io/course/gitops-with-argo) and
[GitOps at Scale (2022)](https://learning.codefresh.io/course/gitops-at-scale)
at [learning.codefresh.io](https://learning.codefresh.io).
Since they were quite fun, I completed them in a few days and received
[certificates]({{< ref "/resources/certifications/" >}} "certificates").

During the course you get familiar with the [GitOps concepts and priniciples](https://codefresh.io/learn/gitops/),
as well as the GitOps tooling from the [Argo Project](https://argoproj.github.io/).

I highly encourage anyone to do these courses,
especially people who want to learn about
[GitOps](https://www.gitops.tech/).
